Machine Learning Model Implementation is the process of building, training, and evaluating a machine learning algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data. Machine learning allows systems to learn patterns from historical data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed for every task. It plays a crucial role in applications such as recommendation systems, fraud detection, image recognition, and predictive analytics.

In this project, a Linear Regression model is implemented using Python and the scikit-learn library. Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable. It works by fitting a straight line that best represents the data points, making it suitable for simple prediction tasks.

The implementation begins by importing the required libraries such as pandas for data handling and scikit-learn for machine learning functionalities. A small sample dataset is created, where the independent variable is Hours Studied and the dependent variable is Marks Scored. This dataset represents a real-world scenario where student performance is predicted based on study hours.
